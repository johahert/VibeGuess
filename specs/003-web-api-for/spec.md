# Feature Specification: VibeGuess Music Quiz API with Playback Integration

**Feature Branch**: `003-web-api-for`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "web api for creating music quizzes with data retrieved from spotify and generated with an AI model like openAI's API and returned in a structured format. The quiz data returned should include the track's spotify id to enable playback of the quiz. the api supports different quiz formats. every implemented feature should be able to be tested to be verified. the api should also be able to retrieve available spotify devices aswell as play a specific track and pause."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Music quiz API with integrated playback capabilities
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: API consumers, quiz participants, Spotify users
   ‚Üí Actions: Generate quizzes, include track IDs, control playback, test functionality
   ‚Üí Data: User prompts, AI-generated questions, relevant Spotify track data with IDs, structured quiz formats
   ‚Üí Constraints: Track IDs must be playable, requires device management, testable endpoints, prompt-driven content
3. For each aspect previously marked as unclear:
   ‚Üí Quiz questions will be generated based on user prompts, with relevant tracks selected to support the quiz content.
   ‚Üí The API will initially support multiple choice and free text answer formats, with track playback integrated; extensibility for additional formats is planned.
   ‚Üí Partial track previews will be used for free users, while full track playback will be available for Spotify Premium users.
   ‚Üí Quiz flow will allow users to play tracks on-demand during the quiz, with future support for auto-play or flow-controlled playback timing.
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear flow for quiz generation with playback integration
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable with track playback functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Quiz with Track References, Playable Questions, Device Management
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an API consumer building a music quiz application, I want to generate AI-powered quizzes based on user prompts that include relevant Spotify track IDs for seamless playback integration, so that quiz participants can take customized quizzes about any music topic while being able to listen to relevant music clips, creating an immersive and interactive music quiz experience with full playback control.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Spotify user is authenticated and I provide a quiz prompt, **When** I request quiz generation, **Then** I receive a structured quiz based on the prompt where each relevant question includes associated Spotify track IDs
2. **Given** I have a quiz with track IDs, **When** I request to play a specific track from the quiz, **Then** the track starts playing on the selected Spotify device
3. **Given** I specify a quiz format, **When** I generate a quiz, **Then** the returned structure includes track IDs positioned appropriately for the format type
4. **Given** I want to control quiz playback, **When** I request available devices, **Then** I receive a list of user's active Spotify devices for playback selection
5. **Given** a track is playing during a quiz, **When** I request pause, **Then** playback stops while maintaining quiz state
6. **Given** I want to verify functionality, **When** I test quiz generation and playback endpoints, **Then** all features work correctly with track IDs included
7. **Given** a quiz question references a specific song, **When** I access the track ID, **Then** I can immediately play that exact track for context

### Edge Cases
- What happens when generated quiz questions reference tracks that are unavailable in the user's region?
- How does the system handle when AI generates questions but referenced tracks have no Spotify IDs?
- What occurs when playback is requested but no device is available or selected?
- How should the API respond when track IDs in quiz data become invalid or removed from Spotify?
- What happens when multiple quiz sessions try to control the same Spotify device simultaneously?
- How does the system handle when Spotify Premium is required for full track playback but user only has free account?
- What occurs when quiz generation includes tracks that cannot be played due to licensing restrictions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Quiz Generation with Track Integration
- **FR-001**: API MUST generate music quizzes based on user prompts using AI-powered question generation and relevant Spotify track data
- **FR-002**: API MUST include relevant Spotify track IDs in quiz data for questions that would benefit from audio context
- **FR-003**: API MUST validate that included track IDs are playable before returning quiz data
- **FR-004**: API MUST support multiple quiz formats with appropriate track ID placement for each format
- **FR-005**: API MUST ensure generated questions are contextually relevant to the user prompt and any included track references
- **FR-006**: API MUST handle cases where AI-generated content cannot be matched to playable tracks by providing text-only questions or alternative tracks

#### Structured Quiz Data with Playback Support
- **FR-007**: API MUST return quiz data in standardized format with embedded track metadata
- **FR-008**: API MUST include track preview URLs alongside Spotify IDs when available
- **FR-009**: API MUST provide track duration and playback timing information in quiz responses
- **FR-010**: API MUST indicate which quiz elements require audio playback for proper completion
- **FR-011**: API MUST include track artist, title, and album information for user context
- **FR-012**: API MUST specify whether full track or preview playback is available for each quiz item

*Clarifications needed:*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Quiz with Track References**: Complete quiz generated from user prompt containing questions, track IDs, playback metadata, format specifications, and timing information
- **User Prompt**: Input text describing the desired quiz topic, difficulty, or focus area that drives AI question generation
**FR-025**: Quiz questions MUST be generated based on the user's prompt, with relevant tracks selected to support the quiz content rather than driving the quiz content.
**FR-026**: Track playback MUST use 30-second previews for free users and full tracks for premium users, with room for future configurable clip lengths.
**FR-027**: Quiz formats MUST support multiple choice and user input (free text) answers initially, with extensibility for additional formats (e.g., audio identification, lyric completion, artist guessing, mood matching) in the future.
**FR-028**: Playback timing MUST allow tracks to be played on-demand by the user during the quiz, with future support for auto-play or quiz flow-controlled timing.
**FR-029**: Device management MUST require device selection per quiz session; persistent selection across sessions may be added in future versions.

**FR-030**: API MUST require that the user sending the quiz generation prompt is already authenticated (logged in to Spotify, with a valid JWT from the authentication exchange).
**FR-031**: API MUST retain generated quizzes for up to 24 hours for session continuity and debugging, after which quizzes are deleted unless otherwise specified.
**FR-032**: API MUST target average quiz generation response times under 5 seconds and playback control response times under 2 seconds, with support for at least 100 concurrent users. API MUST respect Spotify and OpenAI rate limits and provide clear error messaging when limits are reached.

- **Track Metadata**: Spotify track information including ID, name, artist, album, duration, preview availability, and playback permissions
- **Device Session**: Active Spotify device selection with playback state, quiz context, and control permissions
- **Playback Control**: Current playback state including active track, position, device, and quiz synchronization status
- **Quiz Session**: Active quiz instance with track playback history, device selection, progress tracking, and user responses
- **Track Validation Result**: Verification status of track IDs including availability, playability, region restrictions, and alternative options
