# Feature Specification: VibeGuess Music Quiz Web API

**Feature Branch**: `002-web-api-for`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "web api for creating music quizzes with data retrieved from spotify and generated with an AI model like openAI's API and returned in a structured format. the api supports different quiz formats. every implemented feature should be able to be tested to be verified. the api should also be able to retrieve available spotify devices aswell as play a specific track and pause."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Complete music quiz generation and playback control API
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: API consumers, Spotify users, quiz takers
   ‚Üí Actions: Generate quizzes, retrieve Spotify data, control playback, return structured data
   ‚Üí Data: Spotify music data, AI-generated questions, quiz formats, device info
   ‚Üí Constraints: Requires Spotify authentication, AI API integration, structured response formats
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific quiz formats should be supported?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should users authenticate directly or through the API consumer?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data retention policies apply to generated quizzes?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the performance and rate limit requirements?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear API consumer flow for quiz generation and playback control
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable via API endpoints
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Quiz, Question, Spotify Track, Device, User, Quiz Session
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an API consumer (application developer), I want to access a web API that can generate personalized music quizzes based on Spotify user data and control Spotify playback, so that I can build engaging music quiz applications that provide users with personalized, AI-generated questions about their music preferences while allowing seamless music playback control.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Spotify user is authenticated, **When** I request quiz generation with their music data, **Then** I receive a structured quiz with AI-generated questions based on their listening history
2. **Given** I specify a quiz format type, **When** I request quiz generation, **Then** the returned quiz conforms to the specified format structure
3. **Given** a user has Spotify devices available, **When** I request device list, **Then** I receive all available devices with their current status
4. **Given** a device is selected, **When** I request to play a specific track, **Then** playback starts on the selected device
5. **Given** music is playing, **When** I request to pause, **Then** playback stops on the current device
6. **Given** I want to verify functionality, **When** I run test endpoints, **Then** all features can be validated and tested
7. **Given** invalid or unavailable Spotify data, **When** I request quiz generation, **Then** I receive appropriate error responses with clear messaging

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Spotify API rate limits are exceeded during quiz generation?
- How does the system handle AI API failures or timeouts during question generation?
- What occurs when a user's Spotify data is insufficient for quiz generation?
- How should the API respond when requested quiz formats are not supported?
- What happens when Spotify devices become unavailable during playback control?
- How does the system handle concurrent quiz generation requests?
- What occurs when AI generates inappropriate or incorrect quiz content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Quiz Generation
- **FR-001**: API MUST generate music quizzes using authenticated user's Spotify listening data
- **FR-002**: API MUST integrate with AI service to generate contextually relevant quiz questions
- **FR-003**: API MUST return quiz data in structured, standardized format
- **FR-004**: API MUST support multiple quiz format types with different question structures
- **FR-005**: API MUST validate and sanitize AI-generated content before returning
- **FR-006**: API MUST handle insufficient user data gracefully with appropriate responses

#### Spotify Integration
- **FR-007**: API MUST authenticate users with Spotify OAuth and maintain session tokens
- **FR-008**: API MUST retrieve user's music data (top tracks, artists, playlists, listening history)
- **FR-009**: API MUST respect Spotify API rate limits and handle 429 responses appropriately
- **FR-010**: API MUST retrieve and return list of user's available Spotify devices
- **FR-011**: API MUST control playback on selected Spotify devices (play specific tracks)
- **FR-012**: API MUST control playback state (pause/resume) on selected devices

#### Testing & Verification
- **FR-013**: API MUST provide test endpoints for verifying all implemented functionality
- **FR-014**: API MUST return detailed error responses for debugging and verification
- **FR-015**: API MUST log all requests and responses for testing validation
- **FR-016**: API MUST provide health check endpoints for system status verification

#### Data & Response Management
- **FR-017**: API MUST return consistent response structures across all endpoints
- **FR-018**: API MUST include appropriate HTTP status codes for all response types
- **FR-019**: API MUST validate all input parameters and return validation errors
- **FR-020**: API MUST handle and report external service failures appropriately

*Clarifications needed:*
- **FR-021**: API MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific quiz formats - multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, audio clips, image recognition?]
- **FR-022**: API MUST retain generated quiz data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How long should quizzes be cached/stored?]
- **FR-023**: API MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What concurrent user limits and performance targets?]
- **FR-024**: Users MUST authenticate [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Direct Spotify OAuth or through API consumer authentication?]
- **FR-025**: API MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What level of quiz customization - difficulty, length, music genres?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Quiz**: Generated quiz containing questions, answers, metadata, format type, creation timestamp
- **Question**: Individual quiz question with text, answer options, correct answer, difficulty level, source track/artist reference
- **Spotify Track**: Music track data including ID, name, artist, album, audio features, user relationship
- **Spotify Artist**: Artist information including ID, name, genres, popularity, user listening statistics
- **Spotify Device**: Available playback device with ID, name, type, availability status, current selection
- **User Session**: Authentication state, Spotify tokens, selected preferences, active device selection
- **Quiz Format**: Template defining question structure, answer format, presentation style, validation rules
